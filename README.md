## Node-RED

Node-RED is a powerful, flow-based development tool designed for the visual programming of event-driven applications. Originally developed by IBM, it enables users to connect devices, services, and APIs using an intuitive browser-based editor. Thanks to its low-code approach, Node-RED has gained popularity among developers and system integrators for creating automation workflows quickly and efficiently without requiring extensive coding.

## Automation feature

Built on the Node-RED platform, this addition directly offers extensive flow-based programming capabilities to 2N Access Commander. It allows users to connect 2N Access Commander with various third-party systems and automate custom workflows based on events within the platform.

## Caution

To fully utilize this versatile automation tool, it is necessary to bear in mind the following:

- **Customer Responsibility for Security:** Users are responsible for ensuring that their Automation configurations and workflows are secure and in line with cybersecurity best practices. This includes securing the Node-RED environment, managing permissions appropriately, and safeguarding sensitive data within their automations.

- **Use of the REST API node:** If not used properly, this node may lead to data loss or unintended modifications. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the node is configured and implemented correctly. Please exercise caution and double-check your settings to avoid potential risks to your data.

- **Third-Party Nodes and Add-ons:** 2N Telekomunikace is not responsible for the use or integration of any third-party nodes, add-ons, or custom modifications to Node-RED within the Automation feature. Customers should carefully evaluate and ensure the security and stability of any additional components they choose to install. Any issues arising from third-party extensions will need to be resolved by the customer or the respective third-party provider.

- **Technical Support Limitations:** While our support team will assist with issues related to the basic functionality of the Automation feature within 2N Access Commander, including our custom Access Commander nodes, they will not be able to provide assistance with the design, development, or debugging of custom Node-RED flows. The users who wish to create complex automations may need to seek additional support from qualified Node-RED experts or consult available resources.
