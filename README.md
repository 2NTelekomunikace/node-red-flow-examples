## Node-RED

Node-RED is a powerful, flow-based **development tool** designed for the visual programming of event-driven applications. Originally developed by IBM, it enables users to connect devices, services, and APIs using an **intuitive browser-based editor**. Thanks to its low-code approach, Node-RED has gained popularity among developers and system integrators for creating automation workflows quickly and efficiently without requiring extensive coding.

## Automation Feature

At 2N, we have **integrated Node-RED directly into 2N Access Commander** to provide our partners and customers with even greater flexibility and customisation options. With Node-RED, you can automate workflows, trigger external actions, and easily integrate with third-party systems. This brings powerful scripting capabilities into the hands of system administrators — no need for complex backend development.

## Share Your Node-RED Solutions

We invite all partners, integrators, and developers to join us in expanding the possibilities of access automation with Node-RED. Have you created your own Node-RED nodes or flows that work with 2N Access Commander? **Share them with the community!** We're building a library of reusable Node-RED flows and integrations here, on our official 2N GitHub profile, and we’d love to include your contributions. Let’s collaborate to accelerate innovation and empower each other across the 2N ecosystem.

## Caution

To fully utilize this versatile automation tool, it is necessary to bear in mind the following:

- **Customer Responsibility for Security:** Users are responsible for ensuring that their Automation configurations and workflows are secure and in line with cybersecurity best practices. This includes securing the Node-RED environment, managing permissions appropriately, and safeguarding sensitive data within their automations.

- **Use of the REST API node:** If not used properly, this node may lead to data loss or unintended modifications. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the node is configured and implemented correctly. Please exercise caution and double-check your settings to avoid potential risks to your data.

- **Third-Party Nodes and Add-ons:** 2N Telekomunikace is not responsible for the use or integration of any third-party nodes, add-ons, or custom modifications to Node-RED within the Automation feature. Customers should carefully evaluate and ensure the security and stability of any additional components they choose to install. Any issues arising from third-party extensions will need to be resolved by the customer or the respective third-party provider.

- **Technical Support Limitations:** While our support team will assist with issues related to the basic functionality of the Automation feature within 2N Access Commander, including our custom Access Commander nodes, they will not be able to provide assistance with the design, development, or debugging of custom Node-RED flows. The users who wish to create complex automations may need to seek additional support from qualified Node-RED experts or consult available resources.
