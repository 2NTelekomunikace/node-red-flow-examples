# Node-RED Flow Documentation

## Description

This flow powers a web-based visitor kiosk hosted in 2N Access Commander, streamlining the visitor check-in process. Visitors can easily self-onboard by entering their details into a user-friendly interface. The flow then automatically creates a visitor record in the Access Commander, generates a unique QR code for access, and emails the credentials directly to the visitor.

This automated system allows for a seamless and efficient arrival experience, providing visitors with the necessary access credentials for the building and lifts without manual intervention from a receptionist.

Every company in the 2N Access Commander has specific working hours and default visitor groups. The working hours determine the validity period for new visitors, while the groups are used to define their access rules (which zones/devices the visitor can access).

## Features

* **Self-Onboarding:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for visitors to input their details directly.

* **Visitor Management:** Creates a new visitor record in the 2N Access Commander using the submitted information.

* **Automated Credential Delivery:** Automatically generates a QR code for the new visitor and sends it to their email address.

### Flow Details and Explanation

#### 1. Input Trigger

* **Nodes Used:** `http in`, `template`, `REST API`

* **Logic:** When a user accesses the kiosk via the specified path (*GET /visitor*), the system initiates a request to the 2N Access Commander via `REST API` (*getCompanies*) node. This request retrieves a list of available companies and is then used to populate the `template` node, which contains the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to display the kiosk (webpage).

#### 2. Data Processing

* **Nodes Used:** `REST API`, `function`, `change`

* **Logic:** When a visitor submits their information at the kiosk, the flow begins by parsing the data with the `change` node. It then uses the `REST API` (*getCompany*) node to retrieve the selected company's working hours and default visitor groups. This retrieved data is then used in the `function` node to build a JSON body which is sent to 2N Access Commander via `REST API` (*createVisitor*) node to create the visitor.

#### 3. Output Action

* **Nodes Used:** `REST API`

* **Logic:** Once the visitor is created the flow uses two `REST API` nodes, *createQRcode* and *sendQRcode*, to generate a random PIN in the form of a QR code, which is then sent to the visitor's specified email address.

### Troubleshooting

* **QR code was not received:** The 2N Access Commander needs a properly configured SMTP server to send credentials via email. If a visitor doesn't receive their QR code, the first step is to check and ensure that the SMTP server has been set up correctly.

* **QR code was received but no access is possible:** If a visitor receives a QR code but is unable to use it for access, verify that the selected company has defined **default groups for new visitors**. These groups are required to assign access rules for the visitors.

### Limitations and Known issues:

  * `N/A`
