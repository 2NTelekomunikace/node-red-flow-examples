# Node-RED Flow Documentation

### Description

This flow automatically creates and assigns phone numbers from the My2N cloud to newly created users in the 2N Access Commander. It solves the problem of manual number provisioning by using the My2N cloud API to create a mobile video device and then assigning its number to the newly created users, thereby automating the setup of My2N cloud calling.

*After creating a user, their details will open immediately. The phone number is assigned in the background; refresh the page to view the assigned phone number.

### Features

* Automated assignment of My2N phone numbers, eliminating manual configuration.

* Uses the My2N cloud API to create mobile video devices and assigns their phone numbers to the created users.

* Handles automatic deletion on the My2N when a user is deleted from the 2N Access Commander.

* Notifies the administrator if the My2N license is missing.

### Requirements

#### 2N Access Commander

* `3.4.0`

#### My2N account

* Cloud calling is a paid feature and **requires a license**.

* My2N site **must** be a type of **Commercial**.

## Installation and Setup

#### 1. Importing the Flow

1. Download the JSON code [flows.json](flows.json) file or copy its contents.

2. In your Node-RED editor (`Access Commander Automation`), go to the menu (top right) and select **Import**.

3. Choose **Clipboard** and paste the JSON code or **select a file to import**.

4. Click **Import**.

#### 2. Configuration

* **My2N Settings**

  1. Locate the `change` node (*setMy2NDetails*).

  2. Double-click on the node to open its properties.

  3. Configure the My2N details (username, password, companyId, and siteId). To retrieve the company ID and site ID, open the site in [my2n.com](https://my2n.com) and check the URL:

  4. Ensure everyting is set correctly, click on `Done` and `Deploy` the flow.

## Usage

* Once the flow is deployed, any newly created user in the 2N Access Commander will automatically receive a phone number from the My2N Cloud.

* It is strongly recommended to **fill in the user's email address** during creation so that they can use their My2N login details for the My2N application and be notified via email. Without a filled email address, the notification will be sent to the user whose username was used to connect with the My2N API.

### Flow Details and Explanation

#### 1. Input Trigger

* **Nodes Used:** `inject`, `System log`

* **Logic:** The `inject` node is configured to trigger after deployment and then every 50 minutes, sending a message to the `http request` (authRequest) node to authenticate with the My2N API and receive an authentication token. This token must be periodically refreshed.  
The `System log` node listens for `UserAction` events. It sends each log to a `switch` node that checks if a user was created or deleted. Based on that check, it either calls a request to create a new phone number or to delete an existing one.

#### 2. Data Processing

* **Nodes Used:** `http request`, `function`

* **Logic:** If a new user is created, the `function` (*compositeUser*) node constructs a JSON body that will be forwarded to the `http request` (*createUser&Device*) node, which will call the My2N API to create a new calling device using the name and email of the newly created user. If the user is deleted, the `http request` node is used to filter devices with the deleted user's name.

#### 3. Output Action

* **Nodes Used:** `REST API`, `Write system log`, `http request`

* **Logic:** The received phone number from My2N is sent to the `REST API` (*setPhoneNumber*) node, this node updates the newly created user's phone number and then makes a final call using `http request` (*consumeLicense*) to activate the license. If there aren't enough available licenses, the flow will use the `Write system log` node to notify the administrator.  
If a user was deleted from the 2N Access Commander, any associated device found on My2N will be also removed. If the user did not have administrator rights on the My2N site, their account (email) will also be deleted.

### Troubleshooting

* **Node Warn: "Unauthorized, wrong username or password.":** Ensure the username and password are correctly configured in the `change` (*setMy2NDetails*) node.

* **Phone numbers are not created**: The Company ID or Site ID are not set up properly, or a device with the same name (user's name) already exists on My2N site.

### Limitations and Known issues:

  * This flow works only for **newly created users**, old users will not be affected.
  
  * All phone numbers are created in the first position, potentially overwriting whatever was in that position (e.g. a user with a phone number created by CSV import).

  * If you manually delete a phone number from a user in 2N Access Commander, it **will not** be synchronised back or deleted from the My2N portal.

  * If you manually delete a device (phone number) from the My2N portal, it **will not** automatically delete the corresponding phone number for that user in 2N Access Commander.

  * Phone numbers won't be created for users with **duplicate names** in the 2N Access Commander (My2N does not allow duplicate names on calling devices).

  * It is not possible to **select** which **users** receive the phone number and which do not.
